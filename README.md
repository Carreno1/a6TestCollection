# a6TestCollection
A collection of JUnit tests for A6

To contribute to this test collection, please put all of your tests into a package with the following name pattern:

where "onyen" should be replaced with your specific Onyen. 

Your tests should be written using JUnit 4 and assuming that the code to be tested is in the package "a6".

Within your test package, please put all of your tests within a class called "A6Tests". You may create additional helper classes within your package as necessary.

Please be sure to work on your own branch named for your onyen.
